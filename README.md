# Poker Charidema

Poker Charidema is a Poker simulator I'm creating as a excercise in Domain-Driven Design and SOLID design principles. Not everything I do will be good examples of the aforementioned, but I intend to learn and refactor as I go.

There are surely already Poker games built in .NET, better than the one I'm making. I'm purposely avoiding looking for or at any of those Poker implementations, because my primary goal is to learn and practice -- not to deliver a product.

I like the idea of eventually making this into a web application, but I could very well lose interest first.

_Charidema_ is a species of moth. It has nothing to do with poker. I picked it only so that this repository would have a distinctive name.
